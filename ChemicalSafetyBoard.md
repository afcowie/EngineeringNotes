The hour long video that J Lynn first linked me to was "Anatomy of a Disaster"

The whole collection has exceprts, promotional messages, and so on, so it
takes a bit to filtuer out the incident videos, but the good ones tend to have
exciting titles (as Carlos D'Agostino once put it) and be 8-15 minutes long.
