Chemical Safety Board
=====================

The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board is an organization
which looks into industrial accidents and tries to understand why they
happened so that we can learn to do things better.

Have a watch of:

"Animation of Fire at Chevron's Richmond Refinery, August 6, 2012"

"Caught in the Storm: Extreme Weather Hazards"

The recurring themes are fairly obvious once you've watched a couple. Hazards
and accidents can be avoided if companies and employees are conscientious
about risks, make clear plans that put into effect controls for those risks,
and follow the procedures that result. It is sadly too common that this is not
done.

The same can be said of of our industry.

If you're intrigued you can continue with:

"Fire from Ice" about disused piping resulting in an accident

and then on to the hour long video "Anatomy of a Disaster" about the 2005
Texas City oil refinery fire, which is an epic production. It might seem a bit
dated visually but it really set the stage for the significant outreach role
that CSB would come to play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuJtdQOU_Z4

The whole collection has excerpts, promotional messages, and so on, so it
takes a bit to filter out the incident videos, but the good ones tend to have
exciting titles (as a colleague once put it) and be 8-15 minutes long.

going deep, then you find extensive written reports of all the investigations
that CSB undertakes.
